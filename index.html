    <h1>Jason Borochin</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I’m a sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a 3.7 GPA. I have hands-on experience in data management, regulatory compliance, and communications from my internship at StellaLife, Inc., as well as tutoring experience in math and English. My technical skills include circuit design and programming, which I’ve applied to projects like an AM radio receiver and an autonomous light-seeking car. I'm proficient in Python, C, Assembly, and various hardware/software tools, and I’m fluent in both Russian and English. Outside of academics, I’m an active member of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity and have a strong passion for weightlifting, music production, and traveling.</p>
